# xnat-pipelines

## Intro
XNAT Pipeline-engine is a Java-based workflow framework nicely integrated (that's basically its inception purpose) in XNAT. Pipeline-engine uses XML-based workflow definitions for processing data hosted in XNAT by linking sequential activities or steps. 


## Main features
- Provides mechanisms for [batch-mode triggering](https://github.com/jhuguetn/xnat-scripts/tree/master/pipeline_launcher) pipeline instances (via REST API).
- Enables submission of jobs to a Distributed Resource Management (DRM) system supporting the Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA) specification, e.g. [SGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine).
